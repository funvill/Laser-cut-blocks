Laser cut blocks
============

For my niece this year I am planning on making a set of wooden blocks with custom laser cut designs on all the sides of the blocks. 36 blocks in total with 216 faces.

I found this post from another hacker that did a similar project with geek content. 
http://upnotnorth.net/projects/alphabet-blocks/
I copied some of his ideas and expanded on the idea with my own 

Each side of the blocks will have a different theme.

 - **Side 1** - Capital letters from A-Z and 0-9

 - **Side 2** - Map of the world.

 - **Side 3** - Animals that can spelled with the remaining blocks. Words with double of the same letter won't work, For example a Cat, needs C, A, T and works, Koala or Jaguar both need two "A" and won't work. Vulture has two "U" and won't work.

It is nice if the letters match up with the symbol but not required.
