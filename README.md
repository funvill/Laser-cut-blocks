Laser cut blocks
============

For my niece this year I am planning on making a set of wooden blocks with custom laser cut designs on all the sides of the blocks. 36 blocks in total with 216 faces.

I found this post from another hacker that did a similar project with geek content. 
http://upnotnorth.net/projects/alphabet-blocks/
I copied some of his ideas and expanded on the idea with my own 

Each side of the blocks will have a different theme.

 - **Side 1** - Capital letters from A-Z and 0-9

 - **Side 2** - Map of the world. 
  - [Map of World with Glaciated Areas](http://www.freevectormaps.com/world-maps/WRLD-EPS-02-0004?ref=atr) by [FreeVectorMaps.com](http://www.freevectormaps.com/?ref=atr)
  - [Compass](http://thenounproject.com/term/compass/67195/) 
  - [Squid](http://thenounproject.com/term/octopus/27855/) 
  - [Ship](http://thenounproject.com/term/ship/11582/)

 - **Side 3** - Animals that can spelled with the remaining blocks. Words with double of the same letter won't work, For example a Cat, needs C, A, T and works, Koala or Jaguar both need two "A" and won't work. Vulture has two "U" and won't work.
