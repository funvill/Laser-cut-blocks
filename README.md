Laser cut blocks
============

For my niece this year I am planning on making a set of wooden blocks with custom laser cut designs on all the sides of the blocks. 36 blocks in total with 216 faces.

I found this post from another hacker that did a similar project with geek content. 
http://upnotnorth.net/projects/alphabet-blocks/
I copied some of his ideas for the 5th side while expanding it with my own ideas.

Some of the vectors came from [TheNounProject](http://thenounproject.com), others I made from reference images. 

These three sites have helped a lot with finding words that fit the categories. 

 - http://photographicdictionary.com/
 - http://www.mathwords.com/a_to_z.htm
 - I also had an enormous amount of [help from the VHS forums](https://talk.hackspace.ca/t/laser-cut-wooden-blocks-for-my-niece/808?u=funvill) 

Each side of the blocks has a different theme. 

 - **Side 1** - Capital letters from A-Z and 0-9

 - **Side 2** - Map of the world.

 - **Side 3** - Animals that can spelled with the remaining blocks. Words with double of the same letter won't work, For example a Cat, needs C, A, T and works, Koala or Jaguar both need two "A" and won't work. Vulture has two "U" and won't work.
